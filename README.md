- 👋 Hi, I’m @hopefulTex
- 👀 I’m interested in UI design and lower level coding, not so much the stuff in-between though.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang, because the magicians over at https://charm.sh have saved me from learning CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that interests me :)
- 📫 Hit me up at rose103@txstate.edu
