- 👋 Hi, I’m @hopefulTex
- 👀 I’m interested in UI design and lower level coding, not so much the stuff in-between though.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dart lang, initially to learn Flutter but I have resigned myself to not touching that with a 10ft stick.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on love :)
- 📫 Hit me up at rose103@txstate.edu
